IMPORTANT!!!!
before you go and submit what you think is a bug... make sure you provide the following information. otherwise, I will just mark your post as invalid, and off it goes to nowhere land. So if you are serious about helping out, this is what your bug report should look like.


My user name is MOMO, and I came across this bug where, this happens, and that happens. I was able to track it down this far, when you click this, then that, it is supposed to do this, instead of that.

if you dont know what causes the bug, tell me what you were doing. like this.
i was running a mission, and i completed the mission by clicking the link in the email. then i accepted a new filtered mission for deleteFile missions. then the bug happened.

the more info you give me, the better chance i have of finding the bug.
please don't come on here and say, i tried to install hardware, it says error, must be a bug. If you are unsure of the game mechanics, ask someone in chat first if what you are experiencing is a game bug. 9 times out of 10, its user error.
